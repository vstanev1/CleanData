This code book complements the run_analysis.R script. 
The first part of the script reads into R six different data files (three each from the test and the training sets). 
The next step is to combine the data itself (from X-test.txt and X_train.txt) 
into one big data frame with 10299 observations and 563 variables. 
The other files are used to rename the variables, and to convert the activities (coded as integers) into 
factors with labels. From this data frame only the ones the variables with names containing “mean()” and “std()” are
extracted (total of 81 variables). Using the dplyr functions group_by (to group by activity) and summarize 
(to find the mean and standard deviation for each variable in each group) the final data set (called data_summ)
with 6 observations (for the six activities) and 161 variables is obtained.
